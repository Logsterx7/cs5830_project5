##Apple Classification

##Objective

Develop a classification model to categorize fruits based on their features using Gaussian Naive Bayes.

##Potential Scenario/Story:
A fruit distributor wants to automate the sorting process of various fruits based on their characteristics such as size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity. They have collected a dataset containing these attributes along with the corresponding fruit types.

##Method

**Data Preprocessing:** Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling or standardizing features if necessary.

**Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Model Training:** Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using the training data. In this case, the classifier will learn the probability distribution of each feature for each fruit type assuming a Gaussian distribution.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the testing data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to assess the classification performance.

**Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to predict the fruit types of new instances based on their characteristics.
